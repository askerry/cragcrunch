      "As a rock climber, there is nothing more exciting than planning a trip to a new climbing area. However, a given climbing area or national park often contains hundreds or thousands of individual rock routes, and climbers will only tackle a handful of the routes on any given trip. Thus, climbers are often looking to find the climbing routes that they will most enjoy and that will be appropriate for their skill level.\n",

      "The primary goal of CragCrunch is personalization. Every climber is [unique](http://climbingnarc.com/2012/01/defining-your-style/) and comes to the crag with their own skills, preferences, and goals. Similarly, every climb is different (e.g. different types of [holds](http://climbing.about.com/od/RockClimbingTechnique/tp/Nine-Basic-Types-Of-Climbing-Handholds.htm) and [faces](http://climbing.about.com/od/cliimbingtechniques/a/3RockFaces.htm)) and demands its own blend of mental and physical skills. CragCrunch aims to learn about its individual users to create a personalized system for finding climbs that are right for YOU. The key feature of this system is a recommendation engine that makes personalized suggestions based on a user-specific preference model. To do this, I scraped data from individual users on [MountainProject.com](http://mountainproject.com). For users who have not built up an extensive climbing history that site, CragCrunch also provides \"similar climbs\" suggestions on each climb page. So look up a route you love and CragCrunch will suggest other climbs to add to your tick list. The climbing community helped to build this data source, so I want us to have the freedom to interact with the data to meet our individual goals and needs."

      "I want to build a platform for discovering new rock climbing routes, including a recommendation engine that provides personalized suggestions based on user history. How can I do this? Many climbers climb the same routes, and climbers often travel to different areas. Luckily, many climbers also record their climbing history on [MountainProject.com]( http://www.mountainproject.com). This website also logs objective variables (such as rock type, route length, and elevation) and more unstructured content (user-generated descriptions, comments) that could provide useful signals for identifying routes that are a good fit for a given individual. If I can harness this data (objective attributes, user-generated content, logs of which climbers have completed which routes, and whether they enjoyed them), I can build systems for characterizing the similarity between different climbs, and for providing personalized climbing recommendations.\n"
